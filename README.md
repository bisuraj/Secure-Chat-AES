Chat Application USING AES Algorithm
INTRODUCTION
The use of social media has increased with the increase in population. In recent 
years, Chat applications have improved and made substantial improvements to 
social media due to its distinctive characteristics, which attract audiences. It 
offers real-time messages and provides various services like text, images, data, 
etc. In addition, cross platforms including Android and iOS are supported. There 
are now Millions of mobile users who use monthly chat applications. Security 
is of utmost importance in chat applications but few take this seriously. It is 
very important to make a more secure application for better communication. In 
today's time most of the chat applications use Transport layer protocol for 
security. It is difficult to ensure that the data is secured. As the service provider 
has full access to all the messages sent and received by their user.
In this Project, we focus mainly on security and confidentiality of user messages 
by proposing end-to -end encryption. Our application makes sure that the user 
message sent by the sender is original and is not manipulated by a third party.
